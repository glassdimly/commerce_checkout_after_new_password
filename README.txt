THE PROBLEM
-----------

When existing users check out of a Commerce site, they are prompted to log in. If they have forgotten their password, they get a one-time password reset link. After that, they land on the /user/%uid/edit page to update their password. After they update their password, they are not redirected to their checkout page and they become bewildered, disoriented, confused, and angry. Sometimes they give up in a rage. Sometimes they throw their phones across the room.

THE SOLUTION
____________

Redirect the users to the /checkout/%orderid page after they update their password, onramping them into the checkout highway.
